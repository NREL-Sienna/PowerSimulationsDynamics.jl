# # One Machine against Infinite Bus (OMIB) Simulation
#
# ## Introduction
#
# This tutorial will introduce you to the functionality of `PowerSimulationsDynamics`
# for running power system dynamic simulations.
#
# This tutorial presents a simulation of a two-bus system with an infinite bus (represented
# as a voltage source behind an impedance) at bus 1, and a classic machine on bus 2. The
# perturbation will be the trip of one of the two circuits (doubling its resistance and
# impedance) of the line that connects both buses.
#

# !!! note
#     `PowerSystemCaseBuilder.jl` is a helper library that makes it easier to reproduce
#     examples in the documentation and tutorials. Normally you would pass your local files
#     to create the system data instead of calling the function [`PowerSystemCaseBuilder.build_system`](@extref).
#
# [`PowerSystems.jl`](https://sienna-platform.github.io/PowerSystems.jl/stable/) (abbreviated with `PSY`) is used to properly define the data structure and
# establish an equilibrium point initial condition with a power flow routine, while `Sundials`
# is used to solve the problem defined in `PowerSimulationsDynamics`.
#
# ## Load the system
#
# We load the system using `PowerSystemCaseBuilder.jl`:

omib_sys = build_system(PSIDSystems, "OMIB System")

# ## Build the simulation and initialize the problem
#
# The next step is to create the simulation structure. This will create the indexing of our
# system that will be used to formulate the differential-algebraic system of equations. To
# do so, it is required to specify the perturbation that will occur in the system.
# `PowerSimulationsDynamics` supports multiple types of perturbations. See [Perturbations](@ref)
#
# Here, we will use a Branch Trip perturbation, that is modeled by modifying the specifying
# which line we want to trip. In this case we disconnect one of the lines that connects
# BUS 1 and BUS 2, named "BUS 1-BUS 2-i_1".
#
# With this, we are ready to create our simulation structure:

time_span = (0.0, 30.0)
perturbation_trip = BranchTrip(1.0, Line, "BUS 1-BUS 2-i_1")
sim = PSID.Simulation(
    ResidualModel, # Type of formulation
    omib_sys, # System
    mktempdir(), # Output directory
    time_span,
    perturbation_trip)

# This will automatically initialize the system by running a power flow and update `V_ref`,
# `P_ref` and hence `eq_p` (the internal voltage) to match the solution of the power flow.
# It will also initialize the states in the equilibrium, which can be printed with:

show_states_initial_value(sim)

# ## Run the [`Simulation`](@ref)
#
# Finally, to run the simulation we simply use:

execute!(
    sim, #simulation structure
    IDA(); #Sundials DAE Solver
    dtmax = 0.02, #Arguments: Maximum timestep allowed
);

# In some cases, the dynamic time step used for the simulation may fail. In such case, the
# keyword argument `dtmax` can be used to limit the maximum time step allowed for the
# simulation.
#
# ## Exploring the solution
#
# First, we need to load the simulation results into memory:

results = read_results(sim)

# `PowerSimulationsDynamics` has two functions to obtain different states of the solution:
#
# - [`get_state_series`](@ref): can be used to obtain the solution
#   as a tuple of time and the required state. In this case, we are obtaining the rotor angle
#   `:δ` of the generator named `"generator-102-1"`.

angle = get_state_series(results, ("generator-102-1", :δ));
plot(angle; xlabel = "time", ylabel = "rotor angle [rad]", label = "rotor angle")

# - [`get_voltage_magnitude_series`](@ref): can be used to obtain the voltage magnitude
#   as a tuple of time and voltage. In this case, we are obtaining the voltage magnitude at
#   bus 102 (where the generator is located).

volt = get_voltage_magnitude_series(results, 102);
plot(volt; xlabel = "time", ylabel = "Voltage [pu]", label = "V_2")

# ## Optional: Small Signal Analysis
#
# `PowerSimulationsDynamics` uses automatic differentiation to compute the reduced Jacobian
# of the system for the differential states. This can be used to analyze the local stability
# of the linearized system. We need to re-initialize our simulation:

sim2 = Simulation(ResidualModel, omib_sys, mktempdir(), time_span)
small_sig = small_signal_analysis(sim2)

# The `small_sig` result can report the reduced jacobian for ``\delta`` and ``\omega``,

small_sig.reduced_jacobian

# and can also be used to report the eigenvalues of the reduced linearized system:

small_sig.eigenvalues
