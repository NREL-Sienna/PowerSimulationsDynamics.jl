The initialization of the filter provides the values for the P and Q used in the outer control and the V and I needed in the inner controls.\nBased on the bus voltage in the system's reference frame V_r and the bus angle theta the PLL's can be initialized to obtain the angle and frequency estimates needed by the outer control.\nThe Outer Control calculates the internal angle delta_olc required by the inner control to estimate the voltage and current phase difference.\nThe DC Source uses the power set-point consistent with the power outputs of the filter to initialize the V_dc set-points. This value is used in the inner control.\nThe inner control takes the phase angle delta_olc and the V_dc to estimate the modulation values of the PWM converter.","category":"page"},{"location":"initialization/","page":"Initialization","title":"Initialization","text":"Note: The initialization of an inverter through the proposed meta-model is actively under development and subject to change.
