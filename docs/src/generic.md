# Industrial (Generic) Renewable Models

## Connection with the Inverter Metamodel

Generic Renewable Models for PV solar or battery devices used in industrial tools, such as PSS/E or PowerWorld, does not necessary resemble the proposed structure of our proposed metamodel. 

In general terms, a generic renewable model (for PV plant or battery) is typically a Grid Following inverter that uses a Renewable Energy Plant Controller (REPC), a Renewable Energy Electrical Controller (REEC) and a Renewable Energy Generic Converter (REGC) model. The following figure is useful to understand the general structure of such models:

```

In comparison to the proposed inverter metamodel it is clear that the REPC resembles the Outer Control. However, the REEC has a purpose of both Outer Control and Inner Control and the REGC has a similar purpose of the Converter and Filter in the proposed structure. For such purpose, it was necessary to split the REEC and part of its model was included in both Outer Control and Inner Control.

## Example of implementation of generic models

The following includes examples of the implementation of the proposed model in the inverter metamodel.

### Active Renewable Outer Control

The following example join the active power controllers from [REPCA](https://www.powerworld.com/WebHelp/Content/TransientModels_HTML/Plant%20Controller%20REPC_A.htm) and [REECB](https://www.powerworld.com/WebHelp/Content/TransientModels_HTML/Exciter%20REEC_B.htm) as `ActiveRenewableControllerAB` in `PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl`

``` ⠀

An important thing to consider with the industrial models, is that the change of Flags can significantly vary the model and purpose of the controller.

### Reactive Renewable Outer Control

Similar to the active controller, the following figure presents the reactive controller part from [REPCA](https://www.powerworld.com/WebHelp/Content/TransientModels_HTML/Plant%20Controller%20REPC_A.htm) and [REECB](https://www.powerworld.com/WebHelp/Content/TransientModels_HTML/Exciter%20REEC_B.htm) as `ReactiveRenewableControllerAB` in `PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl`

``` ⠀


### Inner Controller

Finally, the remaining part from [REECB](https://www.powerworld.com/WebHelp/Content/TransientModels_HTML/Exciter%20REEC_B.htm) was included `RECurrentControllerB`

``` ⠀

The [REGCA](https://www.powerworld.com/WebHelp/Content/TransientModels_HTML/Machine%20Model%20REGC_A.htm)model was directly included in a Converter Block, and the filter can be bypassed using an `RLFilter` block with `rf = lf = 0`.
