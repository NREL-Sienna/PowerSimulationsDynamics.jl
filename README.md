`PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl` is a Julia package for power system modeling and simulation of Power Systems dynamics. The objectives of the package are:

- Provide a flexible modeling framework that can accommodate different device models according to modeling needs.

- Streamline the construction of large scale differential equations problems to avoid repetition of work when adding/modifying model details.

- Exploit Julia's capabilities to improve computational performance of large scale power system dynamic simulations.

- Provide State-of-Art modeling to assess Low-Inertia Power Systems.

Check the [Project Section](https://github.com/NREL-Sienna/PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl/projects/1) to see the pipelines of new models to be added.

## Installation

```julia
julia> ]
(v1.8) pkg> add PowerSystems
(v1.8) pkg> add PowerSimulationsDynamics
```

## Usage

`PowerSimulationsDynamics.jl` uses [PowerSystems.jl](https://github.com/NREL-Sienna/PowerSystems.jl) to handle the data used in the simulations.

```julia
using PowerSimulationsDynamics
using PowerSystems
```
